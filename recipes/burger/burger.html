<h2>Oklahoma Onion Fried Burger</h2>

    <p>The Oklahoma Fried Onion Burger is one of the<strong>“oldest, <em>Classic</em> burgers in the world,”</strong></p>
    <p>It was created in Oklahoma (obviously) during the Great Depression </p>
    <p> when meat was expensive but onions were cheap—so making smash burgers meant they could use less of the expensive meat and more of the cheap veggie.</p>

        <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add butter and oil; heat until butter is melted. Add onion and garlic. Cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, divide ground meat into 4 portions and shape into patties. Season with salt and seasoning.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or flat-top over medium-high heat for a few minutes. Place patties into the hot skillet and smash with a spatula or bacon press.</li>
             <li>Hold patties down for 30 seconds, then cover each patty with some of the cooked onion.</li>
                  <li>Cook for 2 minutes. Carefully flip burgers, making sure to scrape the browned bits off the skillet</li>
                <li>Press down on the flipped patties to sink the onions into the meat.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, add sliced mushrooms to the skillet used for the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Season patties with salt and pepper and place a slice of cheese on each. Cook until burgers have reached the desired doneness, 2 to 4 minutes more.</li>
                 <li>Top each patty with leftover onion and mushrooms and serve on buns.</li>
            
        </ol>
